            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                                     <p>Ann Maina was born on the sixth day of the 10th month of the 1968th year AD.
                                     <p>She was born to William Gitonga and Sabina Wangari.The two were very excited for their first girl after having two sons.
                                     <p>She was a diligent daughter, always ready to help.
                                     <p>As she was the only daughter for a while, she had roles that were different from her brothers.
                                     <p>Till date, my grandmother always says she always felt at ease when Ann was home.
                                     <p>She studied in Rocho Girls and she always has a smile on her face when she speaks of her experience there.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                                     <p>Ann is a very suucessful woman with many accomplishments but I still remember her tell me of when she first moved to Nairobi for University.
                                     <p>She was so proud of it that it should count as an achievement.I definitely see it as one.
                                     <p>She majored in Education and graduated from a masters in psychology around a decade ago.
                                     <p>She is passionate about teaching till date. You can see it in her eyes when she she sits with her grandchild and they read together.
                                     <p>I always say, not everyone can be a teacher.Not anyone has that kind of patience which is true because i know for a fact i wouldnt make a good teacher.
                                     <p>Due to this, being a teacher is an achievement in itself.
                                     <p>She then became a lecturer at a prestigious university and worked at another University during the weekends to take care of me.
                                     <p>Maybe she thinks I was too young to remember but I remember it all.
                                     <p>Being a sungle mum is not easy, but she is doing great so far and that should count as an achievement.
                                     <p>When I was in my last years in Primary school, she told me that she was up for a job as a Chief Education Officer.
                                     <p>You should have seen how happy she was just for the possibility that she could work in the field she's always wanted and also get a good paycheck.
                                     <p>I was so proud of her. Especially when she got the job.
                                     <p>She built her own house when In 2015 and bought her own car shortly afterwards.
                                     <p>Now, she works as a Sub County Director of Education and I always go around telling my friends what my mum does because i know how hard she has worked to get there.

            <h2>Finale</h2>
                                      <p>I do not know if she knows just how grateful I am for everything she has done for me but I really am.
                                      <p>It was hard watching her juggle several jobs for my sake when I was younger.
                                      <p>It would have been easier for her if she had just asked me to stay with my dad when i told her i wanted to love with her.
                                      <p>She did not have to take me in.But she did.
                                      <p>I vowed to always make her proud and I might have slipped up abit in high school but i want to redeem myself here.
                                      <p>Nothing comes close to the happiness i felt after hearing my mum tell everyone how much i had passes in Primary.
                                      <p>She's turning 55 today.It's been 10 years since we started living together and I just want her to know I couldn't wish for a better mother.
                                      <p>Sometimes I annoy her and vice versa but bottom line is I would do anything for her and I apologise if I ever made it seem like i didnt appreciate her.
                                      <p>I promised her a house when I was younger and I still plan to deliver.
